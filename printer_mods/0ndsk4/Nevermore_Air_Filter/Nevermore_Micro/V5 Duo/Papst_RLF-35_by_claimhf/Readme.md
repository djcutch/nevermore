NOTE: The Papst mod is under development, and a work in progress! Air flow is not as straight as with cut fans, so we are experimenting with different air flow redirects.

Papst RLF-35 is the ultimate Nevermore Duo fan: Quality, moves alot of air for its noise level, heat resistant (rated at 30k hours at 70C) and **requires no modifications** as it has the Nevermore geometry from factory!

Check it out on https://eu.mouser.com/ProductDetail/ebm-papst/RLF35-8-14N?qs=RViDcLGODe10G%252BbWk5yVsw%3D%3D

The one con is it costs $50 USD. BUT, they are sometimes possible to get on surplus sale, like from here:

Huge thanks to **claimhf** for this mod!
